    "Carry out the following tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform detailed analysis of data quality for the dataset provided, making use of some of the criteria discussed in the weekâ€™s lectures.\n",
    "2. Map out, in outline form, what data cleansing measures would need to be put in place to prepare the dataset for ML work. Indicate the types of Pandas-Scikit-Learn python commands that could be used whilst carrying out the measures you suggested in task 2.\n",
    "3. Attempt a clean-up of the dataset using the procedures set out in (2) and (3) and report on the degree of success with carrying this out.\n",
    "4. Submit the final document (in MS-Word or pdf format) containing your responses for sub-tasks 1, 2, 3 and 4 in form of a brief report (500 words). The Python code must be included in your submission.\n",
