    "A student-information-system (SIS) intends to include additional ML-based insights into its management reporting suite. One of the csv data files used to prime the SIS Machine Learning application has been found to have significant data quality issues.\n",

    "Carry out the following tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform detailed analysis of data quality for the dataset provided, making use of some of the criteria discussed in the weekâ€™s lectures.\n",
    "2. Map out, in outline form, what data cleansing measures would need to be put in place to prepare the dataset for ML work. Indicate the types of Pandas-Scikit-Learn python commands that could be used whilst carrying out the measures you suggested in task 2.\n",
    "3. Attempt a clean-up of the dataset using the procedures set out in (2) and (3) and report on the degree of success with carrying this out.\n",
    "4. Submit the final document (in MS-Word or pdf format) containing your responses for sub-tasks 1, 2, 3 and 4 in form of a brief report (500 words). The Python code must be included in your submission.\n",
